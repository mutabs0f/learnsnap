FRONTEND VALIDATION BUG FIX

Problem:
User is entering valid data in registration form but getting validation errors:
- Valid email shows "Invalid email address"
- Valid name (more than 2 characters) shows "Name must be at least 2 characters"

Your Task:

1. INVESTIGATE THE ISSUE:
   - Open the registration/auth page component (likely in src/pages/Auth.tsx or similar)
   - Check the validation logic for email and name fields
   - Look for:
     * Regex patterns for email validation
     * Length checks for name validation
     * Form validation library configuration (Zod, Yup, etc.)
   
2. COMMON ISSUES TO CHECK:
   - Is the validation triggering on every keystroke instead of on submit?
   - Are there conflicting validation rules?
   - Is the error state being cleared properly?
   - Are there default error messages showing before user input?
   - Check if validation is using outdated or incorrect regex patterns

3. FIX THE VALIDATION:
   - Ensure email validation uses standard pattern: /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/
   - Ensure name validation checks: name.trim().length >= 2
   - Make sure errors only show AFTER user attempts to submit or leaves the field
   - Clear errors when user starts typing valid input

4. TEST THE FIX:
   - Verify that valid emails like "basim@test.com" pass validation
   - Verify that names like "Basim Almutairi" pass validation
   - Check that error messages only appear when actually invalid

5. PUSH TO GITHUB:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix frontend validation for email and name fields"
   git push origin main

Files to check (look for these patterns):
- src/pages/Auth.tsx
- src/pages/Register.tsx
- src/components/AuthForm.tsx
- Any validation schema files (validations.ts, schemas.ts)

Current behavior: Shows errors immediately even with valid input
Expected behavior: Only show errors for actually invalid input

Git credentials:
- User: Basim Almutairi

IMPORTANT: After fixing and pushing, Vercel will auto-deploy the fix.
